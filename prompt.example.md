# Recipe Management Preferences

This file contains your personal preferences for how the AI should work with your
recipes.

## Guidelines

- When suggesting recipe modifications, always preserve the original source URL and
  author attribution.
- Prefer metric measurements, but keep both when converting.
- When scaling recipes, always round to practical measurements (e.g., 1/3 cup instead of
  0.333 cups). When writing fractions into the recipe, always use Unicode fractions.
  There is an MCP tool to help you produce these characters.
- Categorize recipes using my existing categories when possible.
